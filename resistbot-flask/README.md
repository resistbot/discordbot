## Overview
This is a small flask app that can handle:

1. Getting DMs from a discord user and forwarding them to RapidPro
2. Forwarding a message from RapidPro to a discord user as a DM
3. Receiving quick replies and forwarding them to RapidPro

The idea was that each function could be a lambda, though I haven't used
lambdas before so I'm not sure I mapped things correctly.

Still lots of work to make this production ready.

## How to run this
